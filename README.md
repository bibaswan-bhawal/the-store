# The Store

The Store is a sample e-commerce platform developed using the React framework and is part of my portfolio of react projects. The project was built following the Complete React Developer in 2021 \(w/ Redux, Hooks, GraphQL\) course on Udemy. Using many of the skills learnt from that course I took the final porject which I completed in the course and extended it to a fully functional webstore with a backend client for shop management (still a work in progress).
